# My First Vuforia Project
## Object masking and replacement experiments

## Scenes
- Main: generic first project that places a cube "behind" (but not really) the default Vuforia Mars Astronaut image target
- masking test: the image target is a book on carpet, and the app draws a quad with a photo of the carpet that is underneath the book on top of the image target. also places a scroll beside this suspicious patch of carpet.
